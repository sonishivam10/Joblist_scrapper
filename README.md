# Joblist_scrapper
A simple web Scrapper that scraps List of Jobs from career page of a company.  

Built using BeautifulSoup and Selenium.
Can be used to scrap data from Javascript Rendered webpages.

Since BeautifulSoup does not execute Javascript and Techolution website is Javascript Rendered, so any data delivered or rendered via JS will not be available  if we scrape with BeautifulSoup . To access Javascript-rendered pages we  need to use a full-fledged rendering engine such as Selenium.
